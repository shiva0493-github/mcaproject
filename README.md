# MCA Podcast Technical Test

To make a podcast SPA based on the information provided in the technical requirements document.

## Objectives
Three main views
1. Homepage
    - Show the list of 100 podcasts
    - Once obtained, the list should be stored on the client side and only called again after one day has passed
    - Live/Immediate Filter for the podcasts based on the Podcast and Author Name
    - Each Podcast is linked to its detail view
2. Podcast Detail View
    - Side Bar with Podcast Image, title, author and description
    - On the right side, Episode Count and the list of Episodes with their title, published date and duration
    - Store the information of each podcast on the client side when it is called for the first time.
    - It should be called again only after a day has passed.
    - Side Bar with Podcast Information should be linked to the podcast detail view.
3. Episode Detail View
    - The same side bar of the podcast information from the podcast detail page
    - The image, title and author should be linked to go to the podcast detail view.
    - The Episode section should have title, description and a basic HTML5 audio player to listen to the podcast.

Header
- The Title 'Podcaster' should be linked to go to the home page.
- Every time there is a navigation from the client side, some visual sign should be there to act as a loader while the information is being loaded.


In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
